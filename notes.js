// Looking at our SEI Cafe App, consider how we can make it.

// Submit a list of:
// 1. pages and components we will need to make this app.
// Looks like a login page, a new order page and a order history page
// Possibly components for logo, menu items and catergories

// 2. Mongodb collections needed
// users, order history, menu items

// 3. what our data will look like in those collections
// data will be objects

// 4. Pieces of STATE in our application (how many, names, and in which components)
// order quantity, if user is logged in or not,

// 5. routes in our Express server
// need a route to add items to order
// route to add new user
